## Bloodlines (Part Two)
Group members: Xiaoyi Zhang, Rachel Nguyen

The assignment description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rlip2kt6V0ZMyBa4NEGXRaaeb6-u5s770kO39Ld1YC8/edit?usp=sharing).
Note that it has both a coding component (questions ten and eleven, which should
be submitted through Github Classroom) and a written component (questions twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen), which should be submitted on paper to
my mailbox in TCL (1st floor).

This repository contains starter code:
- `inference.py`: Code for questions ten and eleven goes in this file

The questions rely on your code from Part One, so copy it over!
- `factor.py`: Code for questions one, two, and three goes in this file
- `bayes.py`: Code for question four goes in this file
- `genetics.py`: Code for questions five, six, seven, eight, and nine goes in this file

It also contains code that you can use and/or emulate but should not change:
- `covid.py`: The Covid-19 Bayesian network discussed in class.
- `montyhall.py`: The Monty Hall Bayesian network discussed in class.
- `vampire.py`: The blood types Bayesian network discussed in class.
- `util.py`: Contains the utility function `compute_elimination_order`.

Finally it contains the visualizer:
- `bloodlines.py`: Run this from the command-line once you've completed questions one through nine.

Ignore (but do not delete!!!) the other files in this repository.
